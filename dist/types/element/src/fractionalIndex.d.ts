/**
 * Envisioned relation between array order and fractional indices:
 *
 * 1) Array (or array-like ordered data structure) should be used as a cache of elements order, hiding the internal fractional indices implementation.
 * - it's undesirable to perform reorder for each related operation, therefore it's necessary to cache the order defined by fractional indices into an ordered data structure
 * - it's easy enough to define the order of the elements from the outside (boundaries), without worrying about the underlying structure of fractional indices (especially for the host apps)
 * - it's necessary to always keep the array support for backwards compatibility (restore) - old scenes, old libraries, supporting multiple excalidraw versions etc.
 * - it's necessary to always keep the fractional indices in sync with the array order
 * - elements with invalid indices should be detected and synced, without altering the already valid indices
 *
 * 2) Fractional indices should be used to reorder the elements, whenever the cached order is expected to be invalidated.
 * - as the fractional indices are encoded as part of the elements, it opens up possibilities for incremental-like APIs
 * - re-order based on fractional indices should be part of (multiplayer) operations such as reconciliation & undo/redo
 * - technically all the z-index actions could perform also re-order based on fractional indices,but in current state it would not bring much benefits,
 *   as it's faster & more efficient to perform re-order based on array manipulation and later synchronisation of moved indices with the array order
