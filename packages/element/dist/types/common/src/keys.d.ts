/**
 * Used to match key events for any keyboard layout, especially on Windows and Linux,
 * where non-latin character with modified (CMD) is not substituted with latin-based alternative.
 *
 * Uses `event.key` when it's latin, otherwise fallbacks to `event.code` (if mapping exists).
 *
 * Example of pressing "z" on different layouts, with the chosen key or code highlighted in []:
 *
 * Layout                | Code  | Key | Comment
 * --------------------- | ----- | --- | -------
 * U.S.                  |  KeyZ  | [z] |
 * Czech                 |  KeyY  | [z] |
 * Turkish               |  KeyN  | [z] |
 * French                |  KeyW  | [z] |
 * Macedonian            | [KeyZ] |  з  | z with cmd; з is Cyrillic equivalent of z
 * Russian               | [KeyZ] |  я  | z with cmd
 * Serbian               | [KeyZ] |  ѕ  | z with cmd
 * Greek                 | [KeyZ] |  ζ  | z with cmd; also ζ is Greek equivalent of z
 * Hebrew                | [KeyZ] |  ז  | z with cmd; also ז is Hebrew equivalent of z
 * Pinyin - Simplified   |  KeyZ  | [z] | due to IME
 * Cangije - Traditional | [KeyZ] |  重 | z with cmd
 * Japanese              | [KeyZ] |  つ | z with cmd
 * 2-Set Korean          | [KeyZ] |  ㅋ | z with cmd
